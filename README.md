General Purpose : 
* Create a quiz using vanilla JS, html and css. 
* Save user scores to local storage 
* Add new scores to local storage when the user score exceeds that of the lowest score. 

### the approach 
Long-winded, at times with far too much emphasis on optimization. 
1. Using built in _proto_ property to store relevant data and functionality together using prototype bonds. 
2. Using recursion to simply call the function again, repopulating the page dynamiclly each time a user click any of the buttons. 

#### The Outcome, 
The major takeaway here is to simplify my train of thought in getting started on deliverables that are easily accomplished by first taking the simpliest route available.
